Certainly! Below is a Python code example demonstrating how to perform Titanic passenger survival prediction using common data science techniques and libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib:

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load the Titanic dataset
titanic_data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv")

# Explore the dataset
print(titanic_data.head())
print(titanic_data.info())

# Visualize missing data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(titanic_data.isnull(), yticklabels=False, cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Data')
plt.show()

# Data preprocessing
titanic_data.drop(['Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'PassengerId'], axis=1, inplace=True)
titanic_data['Age'].fillna(titanic_data['Age'].median(), inplace=True)
titanic_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Convert categorical variables to dummy variables
sex = pd.get_dummies(titanic_data['Sex'], drop_first=True)
embark = pd.get_dummies(titanic_data['Embarked'], drop_first=True)
titanic_data.drop(['Sex', 'Embarked'], axis=1, inplace=True)
titanic_data = pd.concat([titanic_data, sex, embark], axis=1)

# Split the data into features and target
X = titanic_data.drop('Survived', axis=1)
y = titanic_data['Survived']

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train the Random Forest classifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy Score:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
This code performs the following steps:

Loads the Titanic dataset.
Explores the dataset, including checking for missing values.
Preprocesses the data by dropping irrelevant columns, filling missing values, and converting categorical variables to dummy variables.
Splits the data into features (X) and target (y).
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Scales the features using StandardScaler.
Trains a Random Forest classifier.
Makes predictions on the test set.
Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
This example demonstrates a basic approach to Titanic classification using Python and data science techniques. Depending on the dataset and requirements, you may need to further fine-tune the model, perform feature engineering, or try different algorithms for better performance.
